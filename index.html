        <h1>Here, we put kids in charge.</h1>
        <h2> 
          Preposterous? Possibly.<br/>
          Effective? You betcha.
        </h2>
        <p>
          When you trust kids, they trust themselves. For 44 years, we've put kids in charge of their own learning experience. They try, fail, and learn on their own. They learn to trust their own judgment, and tackle the challenges of an ever changing world with creativity and confidence. <br/>
          Campers choose minute to minute from a variety of activities including, sewing, stop-motion animation, music, sports & recreation, makers crafts, bread making, and more. They'll decide what they want to do, and for how long. Our job is to get out of their way, cheerlead creative risks, and provide just enough guidance to make sure nobody does anything totally* asinine. <br/>
          <em>*Totally asinine: By our definition, mistakes aren't asinine. They're how you learn.</em>
